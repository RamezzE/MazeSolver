#### Maze Generation
Randomly generate a maze with 1 solution initially as many times as you want.

#### Solving the Maze

Solve the maze with the first solution found.

#### Shortest Paths

Find all the shortest paths in the maze and view them all with side arrows.

#### Resize the Grid

You can resize the grid and regenerate the maze.

#### Adjust Speed and Wall Thickness

You can pause (speed to 0), slow down or speed up the simulation speed at any time.
You can increase or decrease the wall thickness.

#### Change Start and End
Change start & end positions for the maze.

#### Editing the maze
Left mouse click toggles the visibility of the top wall of any cell.
Right mouse click does the same for the right wall

#### Export as PNG
Export the maze as an image in PNG format.
